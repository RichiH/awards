# CNCF Community Awards

CNCF Community Awards will reward the community members, developers and advocates working hardest to advance cloud native.

We traditionally have two awards a year:

* **Top Ambassador**: A champion for the cloud native space, this individual helps spread awareness of the CNCF and its projects. The CNCF Ambassador leverages multiple platforms, both online as well as speaking engagements, driving interest and excitement around the ecosystem.
* **Top Committer**: This will recognize excellence in technical contributions to CNCF and its projects. The CNCF Top Committer has made key commits to projects and, more importantly, contributes in a way that benefits the project neutrally as a whole.
